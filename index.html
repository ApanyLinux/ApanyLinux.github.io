________________________________________________________________________________

Apany Linux is an Arch based distribution with a focus on simplicity, 
stability and user freedom. It was created by KeremLinux, a 15-year-old 
GNU/Linux enthusiast. The main objective of this project is to make Linux 
more accessible to the masses, by offering a simple and user-friendly 
experience to both novice and advanced users. Apany Linux comes with a minimal 
installation, allowing users to customize and personalize their system to 
their liking.

Apany Linux offers a rolling release model, which means that the system is 
continuously updated with the latest software and security patches. The 
package manager used by Apany Linux is pacman, which is known for its speed
and reliability. Additionally, the distribution offers access to the Arch 
User Repository (AUR), which provides a vast selection of 
community-maintained packages that are not available in the official 
repositories.

Apany Linux is designed to be maintainable by a single person and to    
this end has no infrastructure, backend or monetary running costs.
